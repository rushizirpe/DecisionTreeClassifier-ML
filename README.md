# **ML Models from Scratch**
This project provides Python implementations of various machine learning models from scratch, without relying on external libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The purpose of this project is to help beginners understand how these models work under the hood, and to give them a foundation for building more complex models in the future.

## Models Implemented
So far, this project includes the following machine learning models:

## Usage
Each model implementation is contained in its own Python file, and includes a `fit` method for training the model and a `predict` method for making predictions on new data. The `utils.py` file contains helper functions for loading and preprocessing data.

To use a model, simply import the relevant Python file and create an instance of the model class. Then, call the `fit` method with your training data and labels, and the `predict` method with your test data.

For example, to use the linear regression model:

```
from linear_regression import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
